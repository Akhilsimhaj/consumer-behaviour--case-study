# consumer-behaviour--case-study



Customer connect, Customer loyalty, consumer relationships, changing society, transforming buying behaviours, etc, are the buzz words today around which strategies are being framed by the marketers We see lot of acceptance and also a lot of intolerance co-existing in the present society. Numerous structural and social barriers that have long existed are breaking down leading to a major cultural shih: The younger generation is openly expressing its voice. The attitude of people to different es is changing. Hence, brands are continually trying to cope with all these changes. Brand strategist

Harish Bijoor very well says that, "There will come a time when habits and attitude will count more."

Consumer attitudes are a combination of beliefs, feelings, and intentions related to a particu

lar object, or concept. Like in the present milieu, issues related to environment, society, financ es health, and well-being are gaining importance, and attitudes-both positive and negative-are being developed towards them. It is becoming imperative for the marketers to understand consumer attitudes in order to understand the customers better and also to know how they can influence or respond to those attitudes.

NEW PARAMETERS IN THE CONSUMER PURCHASE DECISION JOURNEY

The internet is evolving and so the consumers are changing and engaging differently with brands

The evolution of consumer buying decision process is bringing in new marketing mantra. Below is

the conventional consumer purchase decision journey

In the conventional process, after the purchase the relationship with the brand is focused mainly the use of the product. Since the time of internet evolution, this process has changed radically Now consumers want to share their experience online after buying the product, and it has created new parameters of brand advocacy and brand bonding. Below is the consumer purchase decision journey process post-internet evolution.


Thus, as clear that brand advocacy and brand bonding play a vital role in today's consumer purchase decision process

EMERGING TRENDS IN MULTI-PLATFORM SHOPPING

In the new connected customer journey, the tech trends and consumer habits are completely trans- forming how, where, and why we buy. An international survey conducted by a global marketing and technology agency, DigitasLBi, in 2016, revealed that the use of smartphones and other connecting devices, including laptops, tablets, and wearables to shop online has increased. The study found that

whereas the global average was five devices, India and UAE used six devices on an average. These trends may be in their infancy today, but Indians are known to leap frog in the adoption of technology. A new phenomenon of huge consumer data explosion and immense content generation has arisen due to the penetration of smartphones and proliferation of screens Brands definitely need to understand and leverage these in order to succeed in the future.

Personalised and special offers by retailers recorded greater sales as admitted by 87% of online shoppers in the survey by Digital Bi. Mobile payment is another phenomenon that is gaining trac tion though data security and privacy has emerged as a major concern

Customer service is becoming an increasingly important factor for consumers to choose a brand According to the findings of the American Express 2017 Global Customer Service Barometer, 30% of the consumers in India are ready to use messaging tools such as live chats and SMS for interaction with companies. This percentage is higher when compared with countries like Hong Kong and Italy with 26% each and Mexico at 25%. Hence, companies in India are also increasingly using social media as a way of conveying the company's intent on service. But definitely a need to balance digi- al channels with physical ones is the key to success

Traditionally festivals were strongly connected to shopping intent. But now with e-commerce penetration and frequent discount sales, purchases have become affordable enough to make shop ping a regular activity. Diwali, India's biggest festival is no longer the sole occasion to get consumers to shop. People are fashion savvy today, and shopping for fashion is turning out to be a high in- volvement activity. These days, for many customers, every weekend is a buying day, apan from the festivals Convergence of categories and channels and easy accessibility of fashion are bringing in such changes in consumer behaviour.

IPG Media Lab, NY has launched Outlook 2017, highlighting 3 defining tech trends of consumer behaviour-Advanced interfaces, Global culture and Augmented Intelligence that all brands should be cognizant of. Touch and Voice are some of the interfaces already being experimented by brands to create engaging experiences for the customers. On the global front, the appeal of sports, music, and entertainment is transcending boundaries and finding wide target base amongst the Indian consumers. Sharp-edged differentiators in the form of "chatbots are being created by e-commerce players which will enable powerful and personalised interactions with the customers. Artificial Intelligence, truly augmented!

NEW INFLUENCERS IN TOWN

Micro influencers are the new breed of influencers swelling on social media today. Neither movie stars nor sports celebrities, these are just regular consumers who after being active on different social media platforms could see the potential of these and get experimental on harnessing content to

influence other fellow consumers. Thus, they have assumed the role of campaign managers, espe cially active on product categories as diverse as fashion, food, fitness, beauty, and music. One such big time social media influencer with more than one lakh followers on Instagram is

former fashion stylist, Shereen Sikka Bharwani, who has to her credential brands like Maybelline, Dove, Jet Airways, who have signed her on for the London Fashion Week. Giants like Audi, Jaguar and Burberry have also solicited her presence.

Another global brand L'Oreal works with about 200 key Instagram influencers. Its make-up art- stry brand, NYX, was the first in the category to be launched online in India in 2016, and the com- many relied heavily on influencers for its promotion.

It's the wide reach and cost efficiency of micro influencers which is making more and more br tum to it in order to capitalise on this medium. "Micro influencers are now being used by about 50 of the brands for their new product launches through Facebook Live, Instagram stories and You videos, as stated by Aditya Gupta, colounder of Genero. On one hand, brands are benefiting from the digitally berate and active denizens of the soc media world. On the other, realizing the wide-scale impact that influencers can create, brands t

Currently, over 2.5 million women in 60,000 villages across 10 states have been trained by 18,000 Satka travelling the countryside on their branded bicycles. A sense of identity and status is insti along with mobility through newly acquired skill of internet usage and additional knowledge. Soc impact beyond measure can be seen through various instances like Saathis using and helping othe women use the Internet to find information about health, government programs, and agriculture In one instance, a Saathi used pictures of formed foetus to raise awareness and empathy which ha helped reduce the number of female foeticide in her village.

Russia, India, and China. In India a new power consumer group, that of rural women is getting highlighted and tapped extensively by brands. Accenture's survey, "Masters of Rural Market series- Women consumen in rural India" brings forth some very subtle and apparent changes taking place in small towns and the villages of India. With literacy levels rising and increasing number of women getting employed in As rural India, the family income is seeing a surge. This coupled with greater exposure and usage of mobile devices and internet is bringing transformation in rural consumer behaviour and landscape

ter

Data presented by Accenture survey unearths some very startling facts and shuns many myths on be

the consumer purchase process related to rural India. Need recognition is triggered by the practical concern over currently used products getting obso lete. 46% of the respondents surveyed cited this as the prime reason for indulging in new purchases Also, the basic necessity and Influence of family and friends work as additional triggers. This gives a clear-cut direction to the marketers to design their marketing campaigns which can tap into the opportunity to replace consumers' existing goods.

While gathering information about products, 53% of rural women depend on word-of-mouth, P while 32% depend on local mom-and-pop stores. This kind of survey finding can be a guiding factor for marketers in identifying right influencers in the local community and in developing an effective media strategy Nature of influence is changing in many parts of rural India, moving from traditional (such as Sarpanch) to newer ones, such as educated youth, friends, and individuals with specific expertise (like electricians who can advise women on consumer durables). While evaluating various parameters of a product before making a purchase, as against popular

notion, price does not account to be a primary evaluative criterion for rural women. Survey found

that just 34 percent of the working women and 35 percent of the non-working women cited price

This is indicative of the big change where the requirements and aspirations of rural women are

evolving fast and marketers in onder to cope have to come up with new differentiations to appeal to this segment. They have to go beyond pricing and talk a different language communicating emo- tional and functional benefas like value for money, quality, social status, increased convenience, comfort, and freedom While making the final purchase, branded products are being increasingly preferred by the rural

female consumers. Survey states that of the total respondents, 60 percent of the working women and 67 percent of the nonworking women cited trustworthiness and reliability as the main reasons for their being conscious about brands. Many of the rural females indulge in impulse buying as well. They even go to nearby villages and cities to make such purchases. Survey reports that they have started ordering such products over the internet also but the trend is slow to pick up due to less awareness and confidence towards online

purchasing Post-purchase, major reason for dissatisfaction which came forth from 84% of the women con sumers was poor performance and low quality of the products. As rural women are not educated enough to go through the process of logging formal complaints, they tend to remain dissatisfied, and hence, lose trust on the companies. One repercussion which immediately stems out of this situation is the spread of negative word-of-mouth, highly prevalent in closely knitted rural society. So, companies have to strategize accordingly to train customers, to streamline a swift feedback and complaints handling mechanism which may build trust and ease anxiety amongst rural consumers Highly proactive and powerful strategy to reach out to customers can help differentiate and win.

Through the survey, more of the myth busters got revealed which throw different light on rural consumers and need to be attended carefully by marketers 35% of rural women as against 21% of the urban hold paying jobs. Women in rural India take greater advantage of social security schemes. As far as the rural women's role in the household purchase decisions is concerned, out of those in- terviewed, 37% of the non-working and 40% of the working women said that they make purchases on their own. Majority of rural female consumers buy high value products as against the popular belief of rural consumers attached to low value goods. The key elements of the purchase journey of rural consumers have undergone a vast change and

marketers need to master the critical imperatives associated with each stage of that journey. Not just in rural, but changes of different kind and magnitude are being observed in urban setting too. A major shift in the conservative Indian mindset can be highlighted through the example of Tinder which recently launched its India operations, but within no time has become highly pop- ular dating app. In a country like India where dating as a concept is not only perceived as a male prerogative but is also seen as taboo, a huge change is being witnessed as women are seen to be more active and engaged on Tinder than men as revealed by India head of Tinder, Taru Kapoor. Today women in India are more mobile, independent, self-confident, and keen to develop their own self-identity than ever before. According to a survey, one in every four scooter-buyers is a woman, and an overwhelming majority of these women customers are young. Yet another survey states that, when it comes to buying high-end bags, most of the women shoppers go for luxury products because of their social circle. All these changes should appear as gateway of opportunities for mar- keters of different brands..

►ADVERTISING REFLECTS SOCIETY FOR A BETTER CONNECT

Brands communicate with its customers through plethora of activities and channels. Advertising a one of the most potent of them all. Advertising is changing now from the clichéd and conformis approach to becoming socially inclusive, more realistic, human, and all encompassing. Marketen are realising that with the buying experience.moving online, emotional touch points are reducing hence, if brands have to talk to millennials and build affinity with them, then they have to touch upon the issues that are important to them. In today's world of digital media, customers are bom barded with different stories with a continuous hunger for more. "Brands have realised that only the most unusual and best stories will survive. So, they have to excite or completely touch somebody deeply or nudge the society in a particular direction," says Swati Bhattacharya, chief creative officer FCB Ulka India. Today in society there are more conversations around subjects like gender equality transgender rights, differently abled people and other relevant social concerns which are getting portrayed through advertising to build the right connect with the target audience.

CERTAIN UNUSUAL INSIGHTS AND STORIES

Big online retailers like Amazon, Flipkart depend extensively on data collected from multiple sources, such as behaviour tracking and demographic profiling, to help them identify potential customers and approach them in the best way possible. This wealth of information thus collected is deciphered to enable retailers to strategize on all fronts for optimum results while dealing with customers. Their data-mining efforts have revealed that young working mothers in their 30s are looking fo

products across categories such as toys, diapers, kids wear, beauty and are more likely to purchase

high-end lingerie from online marketplace. This becomes a fine touch point for the retailers to deal

out their communication in the way that would reach out the best to them Similarly brick and-mortar retailer, Walmart found out through data mining that beer sales would go up on a Friday aftemoon. This data pattern surfaced the fact that it was young males coming to sore to pick up diapers for their new-bors who were responsible for the surge. And behind the data and the fact was the insight that the fathers, who had to stay home to take care of the baby could not go out to meet friends, and hence, bought beer to drink at home. Strategy that followed was, Walman moved beers next to the diapers section resulting in rise in sales

A unique start-up, attending to a social and behavioural issue facing young generation was launched recently known as ilimshaadi.com by its founder Taksh Gupta. It is a matchmaking site which is on an unusual idea as it matches degrees not kundalis (horoscopes) of the prospective couples. Increasing rate of divorces among young couples led to this venture as its founder believes that major cause of marital break-ups is differences in opinions and behaviors, which arise among people, who have dissimilar educational backgrounds and are thus not able to understand each oth er's work and living styles. "Mental compatibility is equally or even more significant than the ones based on caste, religion, or any other factor," says Taksh Gupta, "Education to an extent is a new caste system in place," says brand strategist Harish Bijoor. The more educated you are, with premier pedigree institutions as your alma mater, the more of Brahmana you become, he adds

With the proliferation of the Internet, it has become relatively easy for customers to ga more up-to-date information about the products and/or services before they make their purchase decision. Customers can now validate the claims of the companies related to the products/services beforehand (Ind and Riondino, 2001). The issue of consumer empowerment is increasingly becom ing a popular area of inquiry in recent times and trust-based advocacy marketing is emerging as an effective means to empower cuntomers (Yamaoka, 2004)

The elite and affluent income segments for the first time will represent the largest consumption segment constituting 40% of all spending by 2025

Next big growth will be coming from the new emerging cities (those with populations of less than I million) which will constitute one-third of total consumer spending by 2025

Three-fourths of all households will be nuclear families

spending will be online by 2025 India's consumer market is poised for fundamental change," said Nimisha Jain, a BCG partner and report co-author. "As the consumer market continues to grow and evolve, companies will need to shed conventional wisdom, try multiple business models simultaneously, and be prepared for rapid change internally to adapt to changing consumer needs and behaviors."
